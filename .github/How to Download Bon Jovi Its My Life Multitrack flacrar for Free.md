It is one of Bon Jovi's most popular and successful songs, reaching number one in many countries and becoming an anthem for many fans.
 
The multitrack stems are the individual audio tracks that make up the song. They are usually recorded separately in a studio and then mixed together to create the final version of the song. By having access to these stems, you can isolate each instrument or vocal part and manipulate them as you wish. You can also mix them differently to create your own version of the song.
 
The file format of the stems is flac, which stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. This is a type of audio compression that preserves the original quality of the sound without any loss of data. This means that the flac files sound exactly like the original recording, unlike mp3 files that reduce the quality and size of the audio.
 
The file extension of the compressed file is rar, which stands for Roshal Archive. This is a type of file compression that reduces the size of the file by combining multiple files into one. This makes it easier to store and transfer large files over the internet.
