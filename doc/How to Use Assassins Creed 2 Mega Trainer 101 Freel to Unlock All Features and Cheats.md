## How to Download and Install Assassins Creed 2 Mega Trainer 1.01 Freel
 
The first step is to download the Assassins Creed 2 Mega Trainer 1.01 Freel from a reliable source. You can find it on various websites that offer game trainers and mods, such as [MegaDev](https://www.megadev.info/en/g/Assassins-Creed-2/3), [Cheat Happens](https://www.cheathappens.com/15651-PC-Assassins_Creed_II_cheats), or [GamePressure](https://www.gamepressure.com/download.asp?ID=25832). Make sure to choose the version that matches your game version and platform.
 
Once you have downloaded the trainer file, you need to extract it using a program like [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). You will get a folder containing the trainer executable and some other files. You can place this folder anywhere on your computer, but we recommend creating a separate folder for it.
 
Before you run the trainer, you need to make sure that your antivirus software does not block it or delete it. Some antivirus programs may flag trainers as malware or unwanted programs because they modify the game files. To avoid this, you need to add the trainer folder to your antivirus exclusion list or disable your antivirus temporarily while using the trainer.
 
Now you are ready to run the trainer. Double-click on the trainer executable file and wait for it to load. You will see a window with various options and buttons. You can minimize this window or keep it on top of your screen.

To use the trainer, you need to launch the game first. You can do this from your desktop shortcut or from your Steam library if you have the game on Steam. Once the game is running, you can switch back to the trainer window and activate the features and cheats that you want.
 
The trainer has two types of options: hotkeys and buttons. Hotkeys are keyboard shortcuts that you can press while playing the game to toggle certain features on or off. For example, pressing F1 will activate infinite health, F2 will activate infinite money, F3 will activate infinite ammo, and so on. You can see the list of hotkeys on the trainer window or on the readme file that comes with the trainer.
 
Buttons are clickable icons that you can use to access more advanced features and cheats. For example, clicking on the + icon will open a menu where you can edit your character's attributes, such as strength, agility, charisma, etc. Clicking on the skull icon will open a menu where you can enable various kill modes, such as one-hit kill, headshot kill, stealth kill, etc. You can see the list of buttons on the trainer window or on the readme file that comes with the trainer.
 
To use these features and cheats, you need to select them from the menu or press the corresponding hotkey while playing the game. You will hear a sound confirmation when a feature or cheat is activated or deactivated. You can also see a message on your screen indicating the status of each feature or cheat.
